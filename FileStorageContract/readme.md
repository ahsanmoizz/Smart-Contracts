File Storage Smart Contract
Overview
The File Storage Smart Contract provides a decentralized solution for securely storing and managing files on the blockchain. It allows users to upload, retrieve, delete, and manage file IDs, ensuring transparency and ownership of digital assets.

Features
Core Functionalities:
Upload Files:

Upload file metadata (e.g., hash, filename) to the blockchain, referencing the actual file stored off-chain (e.g., IPFS/Arweave).
Retrieve Files:

Fetch file details using unique file IDs.
Delete Files:

Remove file metadata from the blockchain for privacy or storage management.
Fetch File IDs:

Retrieve all file IDs associated with a user for easy management.
Functions
1. Upload File
uploadFile(string fileHash, string fileName, uint timestamp):
Stores file details on the blockchain.
Returns a unique file ID for future reference.
2. Retrieve File
retrieveFile(uint fileId):
Fetches file metadata (hash, name, and upload timestamp) by its unique file ID.
3. Delete File
deleteFile(uint fileId):
Allows the owner of the file to remove its metadata from the blockchain.
4. Fetch File IDs
getFileIds(address userAddress):
Returns a list of file IDs associated with a userâ€™s address.
Security Features
Ownership Validation: Only the uploader of a file can delete its metadata.
Reentrancy Guard: Protects against malicious reentrancy attacks during sensitive operations.
Immutability: File metadata cannot be altered after upload, ensuring integrity.
Workflow
File Upload:

Users upload their file metadata (hash and name) to the blockchain.
The contract generates a unique file ID for the user.
File Retrieval:

Users retrieve file details by providing the unique file ID.
File Deletion:

If a user no longer wants a file's metadata on-chain, they can delete it securely.
File Management:

Users can fetch all their file IDs for easy navigation and management of their uploaded files.
Technologies Used
Solidity: For writing the smart contract.
IPFS/Arweave: For decentralized file storage (storing actual file data).
OpenZeppelin: Provides reusable and secure contract libraries.
React.js: For the DApp front-end interface.
Hardhat/Truffle: For testing and deployment.
Deployment
