Social Media Smart Contract
Overview
The Social Media Smart Contract brings decentralization to social networking by enabling users to manage profiles, create posts, analyze engagement, and follow others directly on the blockchain. It ensures transparency, ownership, and immutability of social interactions.

Features
Core Functionalities:
Profile Management:

Create and edit user profiles with customizable details.
Post Management:

Publish and manage posts directly on-chain.
Track engagement analytics such as likes, comments, and shares.
Social Interactions:

Follow and unfollow other users seamlessly.
Retrieve lists of followers and following for any profile.
Analytics Dashboard:

Analyze engagement metrics for posts (likes, comments, and shares).
Decentralized Engagement:

Like and comment on posts to interact with other users in a secure and transparent way.

GetFollowing:
Fetches the list of accounts a user is following.
5. Analytics
GetPostAnalytics:
Provides engagement metrics like total likes, comments, and shares for any post.
Security
Permissioned Actions: Only authorized users can edit or delete their profiles and posts.
Transparency: All interactions (likes, follows, etc.) are publicly auditable on the blockchain.
Gas Optimization: Functions are designed to minimize gas fees, balancing feature richness with efficiency.
Workflow
User Profile Creation:
A new user creates their profile with a unique username and bio.

Post Creation and Engagement:
Users publish posts, which can be liked and commented on by others.

Follow and Social Connectivity:
Users can follow and unfollow profiles, building their social network.

Analytics Dashboard:
Each user can view engagement metrics for their posts and interactions.

Technologies Used
Solidity: For developing the smart contract.
OpenZeppelin: Used for secure contract templates.
IPFS/Arweave: To store post content and media efficiently.
React.js: For the user interface (DApp front-end).
Hardhat/Truffle: For testing and deploying the contract.
Metamask: Wallet integration for users to interact with the DApp.
